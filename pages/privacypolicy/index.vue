      </div>
      <div class="mt_1">
        · When you activate a social plugin, the network directly transfers the available content to your browser, which integrates it into our websites. During this process, data transfers controlled by the respective social network may occur. Your connection to a social network, the data transfers between the network and your system, and your interactions on the platform are governed solely by the network’s data protection provisions.
